# BT_test
 Test codes for bluetooth communication

Arduino (XBee is optional) or ESP32
(in fact I wanted to use Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense, but it was difficult to buy in Japan)

2 servo motors that rotate from 0° to 180° (I'll update when I buy a multi-rotate servo.)


[Hardware]
Arduino - for any Arduino & XBee / any Arduino with USB
ESP32 - for ESP32-DevKit-C
